# Spam Detection with FastAPI 📩🤖

This project is a **Machine Learning based Spam Detection system** exposed through a **FastAPI backend**.  
It predicts whether a given text message is **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a trained ML model.

The project demonstrates how to integrate **ML models with FastAPI**, handle request/response schemas, and structure a production-ready backend.
